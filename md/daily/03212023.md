# First Thought
*Imagine that you had to make an immediate decision. What is the first thing that comes to your head without thinking?*

While I hate to admit it, I usually survey what those around me, specifically those I respect, are doing. I quickly exhaust a list of pros and cons, trying to aniticipate consequences. But if time is limited, as it usually is, I just do what feels right. How do I know what feels right? Your guess is as good as mine.
