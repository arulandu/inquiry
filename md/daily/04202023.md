# Masculinity and Femininity
Given the controversial nature of this week's topics, I'm going to opt for talking about gendered language and it's relationship with masculinity / femininity. You see, in Spanish, words like "book" and "work" are conjugated in the "masculine form" as "el libro" and "el trabajo". On the other hand, words like "kitchen" and "mop" are conjugated in the "femininie form" as "la cocina" and "la fregona". Of course, there are exceptions, but I find it interesting that the Spanish language itself evolved to embrace the stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. In recent years, I've heard that there's a debate on introducing new pronouns / conjugations in spanish ending in -e. But, if anything, I think the evolution of gendered languages suggest that the definitions of masculinity and femininity are societal and not inherent to the particular sex. And in that regard, it gives us hope. If we change society's view of masculinity and femininity, perhaps words can change too.
