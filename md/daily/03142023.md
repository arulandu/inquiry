# Bruteforcing a Solution
Regarding the reproducibility problem described in my previous entries:
1. Journals within a certain quartile or impact factor should be required to verify authors. Randomly selected volunteers must reproduce the work to the best degree and provide feedback.
2. Make humans moral...
3. Force all papers to publish code repositories, using open-source licenses to appropriately protect the rights to their work.
4. Build an automated, ML-based solution for checking piracy or reproducibility. This already exists to some extent, but we could make one that actually works.
5. Fine violators heavily and revoke their positions of authority.
6. Make journals free, and replace impact factor systems with stars or upvote/downvote. Then, the reproducibility problem won't exist because those papers won't get rated well. The papers that are truly good and reproducible if feasible will be rated higher.
7. Just don't write papers. 

I hope you enjoyed my very profound problem solving process.
