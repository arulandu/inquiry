# Utilitarian Ethics
Bentham: utility, pleasure pain, 
Mills: levels of pleasure, happiness > utility -> less deterministic so free will
Mills is better but its still really sus cuz like hi i'm hitler and im gonna kill the jews cuz the happiness i will recieve >> than the happiness of all the jews. but hitler how do u know u'll be happy? cause i said so you idiot now fly the plane.
