# Plato's Allegory of the Cave
1: What is your reality?

I am a Christian, a researcher, and developer. As a student of TJHSST, I am constantly immersed in a competitive academic atmosphere, and at church, I am continually exposed to radically conservative ideas, despite my agreement/disagreement with them. I have been taught to question, argue, and think for myself, but I place a great value on individual achievement. 

2: What would it take to be dragged and compelled out of the cave? 

In order to fully exit this conservative upbringing, I would need to be completely immersed in a radically different atmosphere, whether that happen at college or in the workplace.
