# Aristotelian Ethics
Overall, I think virtue ethics makes a lot of partical sense. A person of good virtue resides at a golden mean between two extreme vices; for example, one shouldn't be a impenitent liar, but at the same time, brutal honesty can lead to ugly situations as well. But, what I find most interesting about this moral system is the assumptions that:
1. Human nature is to be virtuous. 
2. Being virtuous is equivalent to morality.
For the former, I think this topic is well debated. Various religions, for example, believe that humans are innately good or innately evil. Aristotle's premise is that every thing works the best when it suits its function, and if the nature of humans is virtue, then being virtuous will lead to the best result, what he calls *eudaimonia*. But just because all humans should strive to be virtuous doesn't mean that it's because humans are innately destined to be virtuous. 

Further, virtue -> morality seems like a giant leap. What if a virtuous person's virtues conflict when making a decision? Does that mean they just aren't virtuous enough? If a virtuous person will always know what to do, it seems like Plato assumes that good virtues will never contradict each other, but is that really true? I think that the intent ~~haha Kant~~ of virtue ethics is pure: people should strive to become better people. But, I see this theory as much more disjoint from the rest in terms of influencing day to day ethical decisions.
