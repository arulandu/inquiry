In class today, we read an excerpt from Todd May's \"Invulnerability Pill,\" so let's talk about invulnerability.\n\n\\\nI think the prevailing thought in modern society is that everyone should be emotionally vulnerable. Vulnerability should be cherished, and concepts like toxic masculinity are, as the name suggests, toxic. Yes, I understand that males in our modern society are taught to hide their emotions: \"boy's don't cry\" after all. But, I don't think that this is necessarily a reflection of society itself. Personally, I don't feel comfortable crying in front of others, and if that's just me being a \"toxic male\" then so be it. \n\n\\\nShould everyone be forced to be emotionally vulnerable? No. Should everyone be taught to be invulnerable? Of course not. I think vulnerability is really just a reflection of personality, and I don't find particular value in denying the value of one over the other. Just because I don't cry in front of others doesn't mean that I don't have emotions or am vulnerable. If I find it fitting to discuss it, I discuss it. I choose when to be vulnerable, and I enjoy being able to make that decision instead of being a sobbing mess every month. In some sense, for me, I consider it maturity: being able to be vulnerable or invulnerable. \n\n\\\nAnd perhaps choosing to always be invulnerable or vulnerable is philosophical suicide itself! By choosing to be permenantely emotionally vulnerable, a person subjects themselves to the power of their emotions, rejecting thought and simply guiding themselves to navigate the fragility of emotional vulnerability. At the same time, the stoic subjects themselves to a 3rd person role, depriving them of experience and subjecting them to a permanent outlook. Being able to choose between the two is not only mature, in my opinion, but it shows a Sisyphus-like resistance to suicide. Yes, we can just let the rock roll, at the will of our emotions. Yes, we can be persistent, pushing the rock forward, and stopping at the top. But, by subsisting, managing both vulnerability and invulnerability, we are, in my opinion, mature and \"thinking\".\n"}, {"category": "reflection", "path": "03062023.md", "date": "03/06/2023", "data": "# Plato's Allegory of the Cave\n1: What is your reality?\n\nI am a Christian, a researcher, and developer.

All work must be replicated before publication by more than three independent researchers. Tables and metrics must be exactly verified, and all implementation instructions or code must be provided by the paper. Besides the additional effort on the part of the journal to carry out this procedure, by the end, the reviewer has done nearly as much work as the primary investigator. Further, for large projects with multiple authors, it is nearly impossible to task one person on replicating the entire paper. While the solution solves the reproducibility crisis, the burden on the reviewer is too large to surmount. \n\nOn the other hand, let's consider an extreme version of the problem. What if the researcher directly made up information? Could this go undetected? At the moment, there is no such reproducibility verification, so hypothetically, a researcher could get away with making up entire tables of data. \n\nConsidering these extremes, it seems like the best overall solution is for journals to require code to be shared along with published work. This guarantees some amount of reproducibility as reviewers should be able to immediately run code and see results, but at the same time, it does not force all reviewers to spend exorbitant amounts of time for verification.\n\n"}, {"category": "daily", "path": "02232023.md", "date": "02/23/2023", "data": "# Challenge: Be A Skeptic\nRegarding the reproducibility problem described in my previous entry:\n\nBut, how do we know that the reproducibility crisis even exists? Perhaps the real issue is that academic papers need a more thorough format. Before preemptively blaming academic dishonesty, maybe the stigma of verbose research writing dilutes the implementation details that are needed to increase reproducibility. \n\nHow is this a pertinent issue for the larger academic audience? If a journal wants to publish quality work, they are free to mandate peer-review or reproducibility rules. However, if no such rules are in place, why is it the responsibility of the researcher to produce reproducible work if that is not the requirement?\n\nOf course, as with any academic pursuit, dishonest people exist, but it is entirely inappropriate to call this matter a crisis, or even an issue.\n"}, {"category": "daily", "path": "02092023.md", "date": "02/09/2023", "data": "# Explain It to An Alien\n**Problem:** How do we solve the reproducibility crisis in academic research, specifically in computer science?\n\nDear Alien,\n\nImagine you make a discovery.
